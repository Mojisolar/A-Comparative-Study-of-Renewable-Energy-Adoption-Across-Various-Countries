 A-Comparative-Study-of-Renewable-Energy-Adoption-Across-Various-Countries
In this project, I explored how access to electricity and renewable energy has changed across countries from 2000 to 2020. Using tools like Excel and Power BI, I analyzed trends, compared regions, and looked at how energy access relates to GDP and CO₂ emissions.
SDG 7 Affordable and Clean Energy (Project Summary)

In this project, I explored global progress toward achieving SDG 7, which focuses on ensuring access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy for all. Using data from 2000 to 2020, I analyzed energy and economic indicators across multiple countries, including electricity access, renewable energy use, GDP performance, CO₂ emissions, and renewable capacity per person.

The goal was to understand how energy access connects to economic growth, highlight top-performing countries, and identify areas that still need support.

Key Findings:
Some African countries are still behind in electricity access, even though global access is improving.

There’s a clear link between electricity access and GDP growth in many countries.

Countries with stronger investments in renewables tend to have healthier economies and lower emissions.

Using dashboards, I pinpointed the year with the highest energy access and the leading country in renewable energy generation.

I built interactive visuals in Power BI and Excel, including slicers, trend lines, scatter plots, and KPIs to make the insights easy to explore and share.
